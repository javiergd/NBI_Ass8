1. Decide whether it is possible to model the following statements in RDFS:

   Statements in RDFS are triples of the form (x,P,y) where x and y are named and typed resources and 
   P is a property with some defined semantics.
   
a) Any pizza is food 
 
 - Yes, because pizza is a subclass of food and hence all instances of pizza 
   belong automatically to the food class: (pizza, subClassOf, food) 


b) Pizzas always have at least two toppings 

 - No, this statement cannot be modelled, since the minimum amount of toppings is set to 1 in the given ontology.
   In order to model this statement, the property 'hasTopping' should have as domain all the pizzas and as
   range all the toppings with a minimum cardinality restriction of 2.

c) Any pizza of the class Margherita has tomato as a topping 

  - No, this is also not true since the Margherita pizza can have either the MozarellaTopping OR the tomatoTopping.
    Assuming this OR is not exclusive, this means that these pizzas can have either mozarella or tomato topping or
    both.
    To make magherita pizzas have tomato as a topping we would have to include a cardinality constraint (or replace
    the mentioned OR with an AND).

d) Everything that has a topping is a pizza 

  - Yes, we can model this statement because the domain of the property 'hasTopping' is the 'pizza' class.
    This means that whenever we apply this property - e.g. (X, hasTopping, Y) - the resource X will have to
    be a pizza.

e) No pizza of the class Margherita has a topping of the class Meat 

  - Yes, the ontology can also model this statement. As it was mentioned before, the toppings accepted in the
    margherita pizza are ONLY (mozarellaTopping OR tomatoTopping). The ONLY keyword imposes the restriction that only
    the tomato or the mozarella toppings are accepted for the margherita pizza.
